1) copied php.ini to new directory where my php was
2) changed every path for each option in the php.ini from "C:\..." to my new location "W:\..."
3) made a new empty folder for one of the options and pointed the option path to it because it could be required
4) copied the apache folder to the php directory
5) moved additional folder from the extras folder to the new location except the sll folder because it was already there
6) profit?
